ISOCameraLDE configures the iPhone video camera for optimal image acquisition of cloaked entities, specifically, by setting the exposure duration to 1.0/3.0.
It facilitates the first step of a two-step process, namely, making media impressions from light that falls outside of the human visual range (but which is detectable by the camera imaging sensor).
Its interface is simplistic, limiting the accessible features to just those required to facilitate the process.
Although some settings are automatic, there are several user-customizable settings:

- ISO
- lens position
- torch level

Tap the corresponding buttons to enable adjustment, and then drag horizontally anywhere. For automatic adjustment, tap anywhere while a button is selected.
Tap the camera button to record video. Tap again to save the video to Photos.
From there, apply a kaleidoscopic or mirror filter to the video in a video editor, such as Enlight VideoLeap or Adobe Premiere.

View the video at all angles and reflection points, starting with 90-degree increments and at least one-half (or less) to full-width, respectively.
